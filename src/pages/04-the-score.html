<h1 id="the-score">The Score</h1>
<p><em>Murder for hire, brutal extortion, dark rituals, illicit deals, smuggling runs, thievery in the shadows—the only chances left for those pushed to the margins and denied the privileges of the corrupt and predatory elite.</em></p>
<p>In <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, we play to find out if a fledgling crew of characters can prosper in the underworld—and that prosperity depends upon their criminal endeavors, which we call <strong>scores</strong>.</p>
<p>A score is a single operation with a particular goal: <em>burgle a Lord’s manor, assassinate the diplomat, smuggle a strange artifact into the city</em>, etc. Usually, a score will fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>criminal activity</strong>, determined by your crew type. An assassination, burglary, illicit vice deal, etc.</li>
  <li>Seizing a <strong>claim</strong> that you choose from your crew’s <strong>claim map</strong>. Claims help your crew grow and develop.</li>
  <li>A <strong>special mission</strong> or goal determined by the players (like getting a rare artifact to empower one of the Whisper’s rituals).</li>
</ul>
<p>A score can be long and involved or short and sweet. There might be lots of rolls and trouble, or just a few actions to resolve it. <em>Play to find out what happens!</em> A score doesn’t need to fill one session of play every time. Let it be however long it is.</p>
<p>The PCs can set up a new score by choosing a target (from their claims or the faction list, for example), by approaching a potential client and asking for work, or by being contacted by an NPC who needs to hire a crew for a job.</p>
<p>A score consists of a few key elements, detailed in this chapter: <strong>planning &#x26; engagement</strong>, <strong>flashbacks</strong>, and <strong>teamwork</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="planning--engagement">Planning &#x26; engagement</h2>
<p>Your crew spends time planning each score. They huddle around a flickering lantern in their lair, looking at scrawled maps, whispering plots and schemes, bickering about the best approach, lamenting the dangers ahead, and lusting after stacks of coin.</p>
<p>But you, the players, don’t have to do the nitty-gritty planning. The characters take care of that, off-screen. All you have to do is choose what <strong>type of plan</strong> the characters <em>have already made</em>. There’s no need to sweat all the little details and try to cover every eventuality ahead of time, because the <strong>engagement roll</strong> (detailed on the next page) ultimately determines how much trouble you’re in when the plan is put in motion. <em>No plan is ever perfect.</em> You can’t account for everything. This system assumes that there’s always some unknown factors and trouble—major or minor—in every operation; you just have to make the best of it.</p>
<p>There are six different plans, each with a missing <strong>detail</strong> you need to provide (see the list below). To “plan an operation,” simply choose the plan and supply the detail. Then the GM will <strong>cut to the action</strong> as the first moments of the operation unfold.</p>
<ul>
  <li>todo Add table p79</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-detail">The Detail</h3>
<p>When you choose a plan, you provide a missing <strong>detail</strong>, like the point of attack, social connection, etc. If you don’t know the detail, you can <strong>gather information</strong> in some way to discover it.</p>
<h3 id="item-loadouts">Item Loadouts</h3>
<p>After the plan and detail are in place, each player chooses their character’s <strong>load</strong>. This indicates how much stuff they’re carrying on the operation. They don’t have to select individual items—just the maximum amount they’ll have access to during the action.</p>
<h3 id="engagement-roll">Engagement Roll</h3>
<p>Once the players choose a plan and provide its detail, the GM cuts to the action—describing the scene as the crew starts the operation and encounters their first obstacle. But how is this established? The way the GM describes the starting situation can have a huge impact on how simple or troublesome the operation turns out to be. Rather than expecting the GM to simply “get it right” each time, we use a dice roll instead. This is the <strong>engagement roll</strong>.</p>
<p>The engagement roll is a <strong>fortune roll</strong>, starting with <strong>1d for sheer luck</strong>. Modify the dice pool for any major advantages or disadvantages that apply.</p>
<h4 id="major-advantages--disadvantages">Major Advantages / Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Is this operation particularly bold or daring? Take <strong>+1d</strong>. Is this operation overly complex or contingent on many factors? Take <strong>-1d</strong>.</li>
  <li>Does the <strong>plan’s detail</strong> expose a vulnerability of the target or hit them where they’re weakest? Take <strong>+1d</strong>. Is the target strongest against this approach, or do they have particular defenses or special preparations? Take <strong>-1d</strong>.</li>
  <li>Can any of your <strong>friends or contacts</strong> provide aid or insight for this operation? Take <strong>+1d</strong>. Are any <strong>enemies or rivals</strong> interfering in the operation? Take <strong>-1d</strong>.</li>
  <li>Are there any <strong>other elements</strong> that you want to consider? Maybe a lower-Tier target will give you <strong>+1d</strong>. Maybe a higher-Tier target will give you -1d. Maybe there’s a situation in the district that makes the operation more or less tricky.</li>
</ul>
<p>The engagement roll assumes that the PCs are approaching the target as intelligently as they can, given the plan and detail they provided, so we don’t need to play out tentative probing maneuvers, special precautions, or other ponderous non-action. The engagement roll covers all of that. The PCs are already in action, facing the first obstacle—up on the rooftop, picking the lock on the window; kicking down the door of the rival gang’s lair; maneuvering to speak with a Lord at the masquerade party; etc.</p>
<p>Don’t make the engagement roll and then describe the PCs <em>approaching</em> the target. It’s the approach that the engagement roll resolves. Cut to the action that results <em>because of</em> that initial approach—to the first serious obstacle in their path.</p>
<ul>
  <li>todo add table p81</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>The first obstacles at the witches’ house are their cunning locks and magical traps. The engagement roll puts us on the roof outside a window, as the PCs attempt to silently and carefully break into the attic.</p>
  <p>The PCs have kicked down the door and swarmed into the front room of the gang’s lair, weapons flashing, into the swirl of the melee with the first guards.</p>
  <p>The PCs have socialized politely at the party, maneuvering into position to have a private word with a powerful Lord. As a group of young nobles leave his side, the PCs step up and engage him in conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the players want to include a special preparation or clever setup, they can do so with <strong>flashbacks</strong> during the score. This takes some getting used to. Players may balk at first, worried that you’re skipping over important things that they want to do. But jumping straight into the action of the score is much more effective once you get used to it. When they see the situation they’re in, their “planning” in flashbacks will be focused and useful, rather than merely speculations on circumstances and events that might not even happen.</p>
<h4 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h4>
<p>The outcome of the engagement roll determines the <strong>position</strong> for the PCs’ initial actions when we cut to the score in progress. A <strong>1-3</strong> means a desperate position. A <strong>4/5</strong> is a risky position. A <strong>6</strong> yields a controlled position. And a <strong>critical</strong> carries the action beyond the initial obstacle, deeper into the action of the score.</p>
<p>No matter how low-Tier or outmatched you are, a desperate position is the worst thing that can result from the plan + detail + engagement process. It’s designed this way so the planning process matters, but it doesn’t call for lots of optimization or nitpicking. Even if you’re reckless and just dive in and take your chances, you can’t get too badly burned. Plus, you might even want those desperate rolls to generate more xp for the PCs, which helps to bootstrap starting characters into advancement.</p>
<p>When you describe the situation after the roll, use the details of the target to paint a picture of the PCs’ position. How might the strange, occult gang present a desperate position for burglars? How might the violent and ruthless butchers present a risky threat to assaulting thugs? How might the vain and pompous Lord present a controlled opportunity for a manipulative scoundrel? Use this opportunity to show how the PCs’ enemies are dangerous and capable—don’t characterize a bad engagement roll as a failure by the PCs, or they won’t trust the technique in the future. Sure, things are starting out desperate here against the creepy occultists, but you’re just the type of characters who are daring enough to take them on. Let’s get to it.</p>
<h4 id="how-long-does-it-last">How long does it last?</h4>
<p>The engagement roll determines the starting position for the PCs’ actions. How long does that hold? Does the situation stay desperate? No. Once the initial actions have been resolved, you follow the normal process for establishing position for the rest of the rolls during the score. The engagement roll is a quick short-hand to kick things off and get the action started—it doesn’t have any impact after that.</p>
<h3 id="linked-plans">Linked Plans</h3>
<p>Sometimes an operation seems to call for a couple of plans linked together. A common scenario is a team that wants a two-pronged approach. “You create a diversion at the tavern, and when they send thugs over there, we’ll break into their lair.” There are two ways to handle this.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The diversion is a <strong>setup maneuver</strong> that a team member performs as part of the plan. A successful setup maneuver can improve <strong>position</strong> for teammates (possibly offsetting a bad engagement roll) or give increased effect. An unsuccessful setup maneuver might cause trouble for the second part of the plan—an easy consequence is to give the engagement roll-1d. <em>If it makes sense, the team member who performed the setup can drift back into the main operation and join the team later so they don’t have to sit out and wait.</em></li>
  <li>The diversion is its own plan, engagement, and operation, whose outcome creates the opportunity for a future plan. Use this option when the first part of the plan is required for the next part to happen at all. For example, you might execute a stealth plan to steal an artifact from the Museum of the Ancients, then later use that artifact in an occult plan to consecrate a temple for your forgotten god. In this case, you go into downtime (and payoff, <span class="term-1">heat</span>, etc.) after the first part of the plan, as normal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either approach is fine. It’s usually a question of interest. Is the linked plan idea interesting enough on its own to play out moment by moment? Is it required for the second plan to make sense? If so, make it a separate operation. If not, just use a setup maneuver.</p>
<h3 id="flashbacks">Flashbacks</h3>
<p>The rules don’t distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a <strong>flashback</strong> to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you convinced the district Watch sergeant to cancel the patrol tonight, so you make a <span class="term-1">Sway</span> roll to see how that went.</p>
<p>The GM sets a <strong>stress cost</strong> when you activate a flashback action.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>0 <span class="term-1">Stress</span></strong> An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity. <em>The Cutter <span class="term-1">Consorted</span> with her friend to agree to arrive at the dice game ahead of time, to suddenly spring out as a surprise ally.</em></li>
  <li><strong>2 <span class="term-1">Stress</span></strong> A complex action or unlikely opportunity. <em>The Hound <span class="term-1">Finessed</span> his pistols into a hiding spot near the card table so he could retrieve them after the pat-down at the front door.</em></li>
  <li><strong>2 (or more) <span class="term-1">Stress</span></strong> An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies. <em>The Whisper has already <span class="term-1">Studied</span> the history of the property and learned of a ghost that is known to haunt its ancient canal dock—a ghost that can be compelled to reveal the location of the hidden vault.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After the stress cost is paid, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there’s some danger or trouble involved. Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won’t call for a roll at all because you can just pay the stress and it’s accomplished.</p>
<p>If a flashback involves a <strong>downtime</strong> activity, pay 1 <span class="term-1">coin</span> or 1 <span class="term-1">rep</span> for it, instead of stress.</p>
<p>One of the best uses for a flashback is when the <strong>engagement roll</strong> goes badly. After the GM describes the trouble you’re in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, “just in case” something like this happened. This way, your “flashback planning” will be focused on the problems that <em>do</em> happen, not the problems that <em>might</em> happen.</p>
<h4 id="limits-of-flashbacks">Limits of flashbacks</h4>
<p>A flashback isn’t time travel. It can’t “undo” something that just occurred in the present moment. For instance, if an Inspector confronts you about recent thefts of occult artifacts when you’re at the Lady’s party, you can’t call for a flashback to assassinate the Inspector the night before. She’s here now, questioning you—that’s established in the fiction. You <em>can</em> call for a flashback to show that you intentionally tipped off the inspector so she would confront you at the party—so you could use that opportunity to impress the Lady with your aplomb and daring.</p>
<h5 id="flashback-examples">flashback examples</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “I want to have a flashback to earlier that night, where I sneak into the stables and feed fireweed to all their goats so they’ll go berserk and create a distraction for our infiltration.”
    “Ha! Nice. Okay, that’s seems a bit tricky, dealing with ornery goats and all... 1 stress.”
    “Should I roll Prowl to sneak in and plant it?”
    “Nah. Their goat stable security amounts to a stable boy who is usually asleep anyway. You can easily avoid their notice.”
    “So it just works?”
    “Eh... not so fast. When you want the distraction to hit, let’s make a fortune roll to see how crazy the Fireweed Goat Maneuver gets. Three dice.”
    “The engagement roll is... a 2. Looks like a desperate situation for you! Hmmm. Okay, so you’re inside the gang’s compound at the docks, slipping up through the shadows next to some huge metal storage tanks. But then all the electric lights come on. The big metal warehouse door rolls open, and you hear a heavy wagon coming in through the gate. Looks like they’re getting a delivery right now, and a bunch of gang members are out to receive it. They’re about to be on top of you. What do you do?”
    “Hang on, I want to have a flashback.”
    “Okay, for what?”
    “Uh. Something... helpful? Damn, I don’t know what that would be. Anyone have ideas?”
    “Oh, what if you Consorted with your docker friends yesterday and they blabbed about this delivery, so we rigged it with a bomb.”
    “Oh man, that’s hilarious. But kind of nuts. I guess 2 stress for that?”
    “Sounds good. But let’s make that Consort roll and see if your docker friends made any demands or complicated anything for you. Then we need to find out how well this bomb works. Who was in charge of that?”
    “I did it. I’ll roll Tinker to set the fuse just right. Hopefully.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="giving-up-on-a-score">Giving up on a score</h3>
<p>When you give up on a score, you go into <strong>downtime</strong>. Follow the phases for downtime presented in the next chapter. You’ll usually have zero <strong>payoff</strong>, since you didn’t accomplish anything. You’ll still face <span class="term-1">heat</span> and <strong>entanglements</strong> as usual.</p>
<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<p>When the team of PCs works together, the characters have access to four special <strong>teamwork maneuvers</strong>. They’re listed at the bottom of the character playbook sheets to help remind the players of them. The four maneuvers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Assist</strong> another PC who’s rolling an action.</li>
  <li>Lead a <strong>group action</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect</strong> a teammate.</li>
  <li><strong>Set up</strong> a character who will follow through on your action.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assist">Assist</h3>
<p>When you assist another player who’s rolling, describe what your character does to help. Take 1 stress and give them <strong>+1d</strong> to their roll. You might also suffer any consequences that occur because of the roll, depending on the circumstances. Only one character may assist a given roll. <em>If you really want to help and someone else is already assisting, consider performing a <strong>setup</strong> maneuver instead.</em></p>
<p>A character may assist a group action, but only if they aren’t taking part in it directly. You decide which character in the group action gets the bonus die.</p>
<h3 id="lead-a-group-action">Lead a group action</h3>
<p>When you lead a group action, you coordinate multiple members of the team to tackle a problem together. Describe how your character leads the team in a coordinated effort. Do you bark orders, give subtle hand signals, or provide charismatic inspiration?</p>
<p>Each PC who’s involved makes an <strong>action roll</strong> (using the same action) and <strong>the team counts the single best result</strong> as the overall effort for everyone who rolled. However, the character leading the group action takes <strong>1 stress</strong> for each PC that rolled <strong>1-3</strong> as their best result.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is how you do the “we all sneak into the building” scene. Everyone who wants to sneak in rolls their Prowl action, and the best result counts for the whole team. The leader suffers stress for everyone who does poorly. It’s tough covering for the stragglers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The group action result covers everyone who rolled.</strong> If you don’t roll, your character doesn’t get the effects of the action.</p>
<p>Your character doesn’t have to be especially skilled at the action at hand in order to lead a group action. This maneuver is about leadership, not necessarily about ability. You can also lead your crew’s <strong>cohorts</strong> with a group action. Roll <span class="term-1">Command</span> if you direct their efforts, or roll the appropriate action rating if you participate alongside them. The cohort rolls its <strong>quality</strong> level.</p>
<h3 id="protect">Protect</h3>
<p>You step in to face a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. <strong>You suffer it instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.</strong> Describe how you intervene.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is how you do the “I’ll dive in front of the bullet” You cover for a teammate, suffering any harm or consequences that still linger after you’ve rolled to resist. It hurts, cost stress, and may leave you in a bad spot. But hey, you’re a hero.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="set-up">Set up</h3>
<p>When you perform a setup action, you have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets <strong>+1 effect level</strong> or <strong>improved position</strong> for their roll. You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is how you do the “I’ll create a distraction” scene. You roll <span class="term-1">Sway</span> to distract a constable with your charms, then any teammate who follows through with a <span class="term-1">Prowl</span> action to sneak past him can get improved position. It’s less risky since you’re drawing the guard’s attention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good way to contribute to an operation when you don’t have a good rating in the action at hand. A clever setup action lets you help the team indirectly. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup (including someone <strong>leading</strong> a group action) as long as it makes sense in the fiction.</p>
<p>Since a setup action can increase the effect of follow-up actions, it’s also useful when the team is facing tough opposition that has advantages in quality, scale, and/or potency. Even if the PCs are reduced to zero effect due to disadvantages in a situation, the setup action provides a bonus that allows for limited effect.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The PCs are facing a heavily armored carriage that’s immune to their weapons. Aldo uses <span class="term-1">Wreck</span> as a setup action to pry some of the armor loose with his crowbar, giving follow up actions +1 effect—going from zero to limited effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="do-we-have-to-use-teamwork">Do We Have to Use Teamwork?</h3>
<p>Teamwork maneuvers are options, not requirements. Each character can still perform solo actions as normal during an operation. If your character can’t communicate or somehow coordinate with the rest of the team, you can’t use or benefit from any teamwork maneuvers.</p>
<h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2>
<p>After the crew finishes a score (succeed or fail), they take time to recover, regroup, and prepare for the next operation. This phase of the game is called <strong>downtime</strong>.</p>
<p>Downtime fulfills two purposes in the game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, it’s a break for the players. During the action of the score, the PCs are always under threat, charging from obstacle to obstacle in a high-energy sequence. Downtime gives them a reprieve so they can catch their breath and relax a bit—focus on lower-energy, quieter elements of the game, as well as explore personal aspects of their characters.</li>
  <li>Second, the shift into a new phase of the game signals a shift in which mechanics are needed. There are special rules that are only used during the downtime phase, so they’re kept “out of the way” during the other parts of play. When we shift into downtime, we take out a different toolbox and resolve downtime on its own terms, then shift back into the more action-focused phases of the game afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Downtime is divided into four parts, which are resolved in order:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="term-1">Payoff</span> The crew receives their rewards from a successfully completed score.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Heat</span> The crew accumulates suspicion and attention from the law and the powers-that-be in the city as a result of their last score.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Entanglements</span> The crew faces trouble from the rival factions, the law, and the haunted city itself.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Downtime Activities</span> The PCs indulge their vices to remove stress, work on long-term projects, recover from injuries, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the downtime activities are resolved, the game returns to free play, and the group can move toward their next score.</p>
<h2 id="payoff">Payoff</h2>
<p>After a score, the PCs take stock of their income from the operation. A successful score generates both <span class="term-1">rep</span> and <span class="term-1">coin</span>.</p>
<p>The crew earns 2 <span class="term-1">rep</span> per score by default. If the target of the score is higher Tier than you, take <strong>+1 <span class="term-1">rep</span> per Tier higher</strong>. If the target of the score is lower Tier, you get <strong>-1*<span class="term-1">rep</span> per Tier lower</strong> (minimum zero).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If your crew is Tier I and you pull off a successful score against a Tier III target, you earn 4 <span class="term-1">rep</span> (2 <span class="term-1">rep</span>, +2 <span class="term-1">rep</span> for a target two tiers above you). If your crew is Tier III and you complete a score against a Tier I target, you earn 0 <span class="term-1">rep</span> (2 rep, -2 rep for the lower Tier target).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you keep the operation completely quiet so no one knows about it, you earn zero <span class="term-1">rep</span>. Mark the rep on the <span class="term-1">rep</span> tracker on the crew sheet.</p>
<p>The crew earns <span class="term-1">coin</span> based on the nature of the operation and/or any loot they seized:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="term-1">2 coin</span> A minor job; several full purses.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">4 coin</span> A small job; a strongbox.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">6 coin</span> A standard score; decent loot.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">8 coin</span> A big score; serious loot.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">10+ coin</span> A major score; impressive loot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Record the <span class="term-1">coin</span> on the crew sheet, or divvy it up among the crew members as you see fit.</p>
<p>Most districts have crime bosses that expect smaller crews to pay a tithe from their scores. Ask the GM if there’s a boss that you should be paying. <strong>Subtract <span class="term-1">coin</span> equal to your crew Tier +1</strong> when you pay a tithe to a boss or larger organization. <em>If you’re supposed to be paying off a boss, but you don’t, start a clock for that boss’s patience running out. Tick it whenever you don’t pay. Every time it fills up, lose 1 faction status with them.</em></p>
<p>You can set the scene and play out a meeting with a client or patron who’s paying the crew if there’s something interesting to explore there. If not, just gloss over it and move on to the next part of downtime.</p>
<p>GM, definitely don’t screw around with the players when it comes to the payoff. Don’t say that the client lied and there’s no reward. Or that the meeting for the payment is actually a trap, or whatever. These types of things are staples of crime fiction, but in <em>Blades</em>, the PCs have enough problems coming at them from every direction already. When it comes to getting paid, just give them what they earned.</p>
<h2 id="heat">Heat</h2>
<p>The city is full of prying eyes and informants. Anything you do might be witnessed, and there’s always evidence left behind. To reflect this, your crew acquires <span class="term-1">heat</span> as they commit crimes. After a score or conflict with an opponent, your crew takes <span class="term-1">heat</span> according to the nature of the operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="term-1">0 heat</span>: Smooth &#x26; quiet; low exposure.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">2 heat</span>: Contained; standard exposure.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">4 heat</span>: Loud &#x26; chaotic; high exposure.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">6 heat</span>: Wild; devastating exposure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add +1 <span class="term-1">heat</span> for a high-profile or well-connected target. Add +1 <span class="term-1">heat</span> if the situation happened on hostile turf. Add +1 <span class="term-1">heat</span> if you’re at war with another faction. Add +2 <span class="term-1">heat</span> if killing was involved (whether the crew did the killing or not—bodies draw attention).</p>
<p>You mark <span class="term-1">heat</span> levels on the <span class="term-1">heat</span> tracker on the crew sheet.</p>
<ul>
  <li>todo add table p91</li>
</ul>
<p>When your <span class="term-1">heat</span> level reaches 9, you gain a <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> and clear your <span class="term-1">heat</span> (any excess <span class="term-1">heat</span> “rolls over,” so if your <span class="term-1">heat</span> was 7 and you took 4 <span class="term-1">heat</span>, you’d reset with 2 <span class="term-1">heat</span> marked).</p>
<p>The higher your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span>, the more serious the response when law enforcement takes action against you (they’ll send a force of higher <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>scale</strong>).</p>
<p>Also, your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> contributes to the severity of the <strong>entanglements</strong> that your crew faces after a score.</p>
<h3 id="incarceration">Incarceration</h3>
<p>The only way to reduce your crew’s <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> is through incarceration. When one of your crew members, friends, contacts—or a framed enemy—is convicted and incarcerated for crimes associated with your crew, your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> is reduced by 1 and you clear your <span class="term-1">heat</span>.</p>
<p>Incarceration may result from investigation and arrest by the officers, or because someone turns themselves in and takes the fall for the crew’s crimes.</p>
<p>The severity of the prison sentence depends on your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="term-1">Wanted Level 4</span> Life or execution.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Wanted Level 3</span> A year or two.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Wanted Level 2</span> Several months.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Wanted Level 1</span> A month or two.</li>
  <li><span class="term-1">Wanted Level 0</span> A few weeks. Or, the constables give you a beating to teach you a lesson (suffer level 3 harm, no resistance roll allowed—they keep going until you’re injured).</li>
</ul>
<p>Incarceration is dehumanizing and brutal. The renown of your crew is your only real defense inside. When you serve your time, make an <strong>incarceration roll</strong> using your crew’s Tier as the dice pool.</p>

<p>You claim several prison guards on your payroll. Take +1d to your Tier roll when a member of your crew is incarcerated.</p>
<h4 id="hardcase">Hardcase</h4>
<p>Your reputation as a tough inmate bolsters your crew’s image. When your crew advances Tier, it costs 2 fewer <span class="term-1">coins</span> than it normally would.</p>
<h4 id="parole-influence">Parole influence</h4>
<p>Political pressures of various sorts can be applied to the magistrates and warden who oversee sentences for crimes. With this claim, you’re always able to arrange for a shorter prison stay—as if your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> was 1 lower. So, if your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> was 3 when you went in, you’d spend only several months behind bars (equivalent to level 2) instead of a full year.</p>
<h4 id="smuggling">Smuggling</h4>
<p>You arrange smuggling channels inside. You have <strong>+2 load</strong> while incarcerated, (starting from zero as a prisoner). If you take this claim twice, you’ll have 4 load while you’re serving time in Ironhook. Also, you may choose to carry <span class="term-1">coin</span> in place of load for purposes of bribes or acquiring assets while in prison. You may reset the items in your prison loadout whenever your crew has downtime.</p>
<h2 id="entanglements">Entanglements</h2>
<p>Your crew didn’t just spring into existence tonight. You have a complex history of favors, commitments, debts, and promises that got you where you are today. To reflect this, after each score, you roll dice to find out which <strong>entanglement</strong> comes calling. An entanglement might be a rival crew looking to throw their weight around (and demand some <span class="term-1">coin</span>), an Investigator of the City Watch making a case against your crew (but ready for a bribe), or even the attention of a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>After payoff and <span class="term-1">heat</span> are determined, the GM generates an entanglement for the crew using the lists below. Find the column that matches the crew’s current <span class="term-1">heat</span> level. Then roll a number of dice equal to their <span class="term-1">wanted level</span>, and use the result of the roll to select which sort of entanglement manifests. <em>If <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> is zero, roll two dice and keep the lowest result.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>todo add table p94</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring the entanglement into play immediately, or hold off until an appropriate moment. For example, if you get the <em>Interrogation</em> entanglement, you might wait until a PC indulges their vice, then say the constables picked them up when they were distracted by its pleasures.</p>
<p>Entanglements manifest fully before the PCs have a chance to avoid them. When an entanglement comes into play, describe the situation after the entanglement has manifested. The PCs deal with it from that point—they can’t intercept it and defuse it before it happens. The purpose of the mechanic is to abstract a lot of the complex stuff happening in the backgrounds of the characters’ lives in order to generate trouble for them. Entanglements are the cost of doing business in the underworld—a good crew learns to roll with the punches and pick their battles.</p>
<p>The entanglements are detailed on the following pages. Each has a list of potential ways for the PCs to be rid of it. If you want the entanglements to be a momentary problem for the crew, stick to the suggested methods to resolve them, and move on to the next part of downtime. If you want to dive in and explore the entanglement in detail, set the scene and play out the event in full, following the actions and consequences where they lead.</p>
<h3 id="arrest">Arrest</h3>
<p>An Inspector presents a case file of evidence to a magistrate, to begin prosecution of your crew. They send a detail to arrest you (a gang at least equal in <strong>scale</strong> to your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span>). Pay them off with <span class="term-1">coin</span> equal to your <span class="term-1">wanted level</span> +3, hand someone over for arrest (this clears your <span class="term-1">heat</span>), or try to evade capture.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A truncheon bangs on the shutters of the window. “Alright then! Come on out and let’s go quietly now!” It sounds like the bald Sergeant. When you peek out, you see a detail of about twenty constables, all geared up for a fight. The Sergeant mumbles under his breath, so only you inside can hear: “Or perhaps I have the wrong address?” He clears his throat and waits for some coin to appear.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cooperation">Cooperation</h3>
<p>A +3 status faction asks you for a favor. Agree to do it, or forfeit 1 <span class="term-1">rep</span> per Tier of the friendly faction, or lose <strong>1 status</strong> with them. If you don’t have a +3 faction status, you avoid entanglements right now.</p>
<h3 id="demonic-notice">Demonic notice</h3>
<p>A demon approaches the crew with a dark offer. Accept their bargain, hide until it loses interest (forfeit 3 <span class="term-1">rep</span>), or deal with it another way.</p>
<h3 id="flipped">Flipped</h3>
<p>One of the PCs’ rivals arranges for one of your contacts, patrons, clients, or a group of your customers to switch allegiances due to the <span class="term-1">heat</span> on you. They’re loyal to another faction now.</p>
<h3 id="gang-trouble">Gang trouble</h3>
<p>One of your gangs (or other cohorts) causes trouble due to their flaw(s). You can lose face (forfeit <span class="term-1">rep</span> equal to your Tier +1), make an example of one of the gang members, or face reprisals from the wronged party.</p>
<h3 id="interrogation">Interrogation</h3>
<p>The officers round up one of the PCs to question them about the crew’s crimes. <em>How did they manage to capture you?</em> Either pay them off with 3 <span class="term-1">coin</span>, or they beat you up (<strong>level 2 harm</strong>) and you tell them what they want to know (<strong>+3</strong> <span class="term-1">heat</span>). You can <strong>resist</strong> each of those consequences separately.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some players really hate it when their character gets captured! Just tell them that this is completely normal for a scoundrel of the underworld. You spend time in and out of jail, getting questioned and harassed by the law. It’s not the end of the world. But now that you’re here in the interrogation room, what kind of person are you? Do you talk? Do you stand up to them? Do you make a deal?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="questioning">Questioning</h3>
<p>The cops grab an NPC member of your crew or one of the crew’s contacts, to question them about your crimes. <em>Who do they think is most vulnerable?</em> Make a <strong>fortune roll</strong> to see how much they talk (<strong>1-3:</strong> <strong>+2</strong> <span class="term-1">heat</span>, <strong>4/5</strong> <strong>+1</strong> <span class="term-1">heat</span>), or pay the constables off with 2 <span class="term-1">coin</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Roll 2d for a normal person to see how well they keep quiet. If they’re an experienced underworld type or some kind of tough, give them 3d or 4d instead. If they’re soft or if they have some loyalty to the law, give them 1d or 0d.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reprisals">Reprisals</h3>
<p>An enemy faction makes a move against you (or a friend, contact, or vice purveyor). Pay them (1 <span class="term-1">rep</span> and 1 <span class="term-1">coin</span>) per Tier of the enemy as an apology, allow them to mess with you or yours, or fight back and show them who’s boss.</p>
<h3 id="rivals">Rivals</h3>
<p>A neutral faction throws their weight around. They threaten you, a friend, a contact, or one of your vice purveyors. Forfeit (1 <span class="term-1">rep</span> or 1 <span class="term-1">coin</span>) per Tier of the rival, or stand up to them and lose 1 <span class="term-1">status</span> with them.</p>
<h3 id="show-of-force">Show of force</h3>
<p>A faction with whom you have a negative status makes a play against your holdings. Give them 1 <strong>claim</strong> or go to war (drop to -3 status). If you have no claims, <strong>lose 1 hold</strong> instead.</p>
<h3 id="unquiet-dead">Unquiet dead</h3>
<p>A rogue spirit is drawn to you—perhaps it’s a past victim? Acquire the services of an occultist to attempt to destroy or banish it, or deal with it yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>They can hire an NPC by using the <span class="term-1">acquire asset</span> downtime activity. Roll the NPC’s quality level as a fortune roll to see how well they deal with the spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-usual-suspects">The usual suspects</h3>
<p>The cops grab someone in the periphery of your crew. One player volunteers a friend or vice purveyor as the person most likely to be taken. Make a <strong>fortune roll</strong> to find out if they resist questioning (<strong>1-3</strong>: <strong>+2 <span class="term-1">heat</span>, 4/5: level 2 harm</strong>), or pay them off with 1 <span class="term-1">coin</span>.</p>
